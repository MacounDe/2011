// in pixels. The result is (mostly) the same as Qaurtzâ€™ anti-aliasing, but without introducing alpha in the line color.
// The has the advantage that overlapping lines and lines drawn over background remain opaque.
// The passed in color is blended with 'backgroundColor' by the relation between ideal and pixel line width.
// The passed in width is modified to result in an integral number of pixels when set as line width.
// '*outSnapMode' is set to the pixel snap mode which should be used to grid snap the coordinates of the line before
// drawing.
// The method uses 'pixelPerPoint', make sure it is flushed first if necessary.
// For printing the color and line width are not changed and '*outSnapMode' is set to PWSnapToPixelOff.
// 'inOutColor' and 'outSnapMode' are optional.

// Before drawing, coordinates should be snapped to device pixel positions to avoid unwanted anti-aliasing artefacts.
// Typically, coordinates for fill-only operations are snapped to full pixels (PWSnapToFullPixel).
// Coordinates for stroking should be snapped with the mode returned by -screenifyLineColor: If ever possible, for a
// fill plus stroke combination, both should be done with identical coordinates snapped with the same modes. This is the
// only method to guarantee that fill and border always correctly align on both screen and print.
// See also PWQuartzUtilities.h for additional information, including the use of 'pixelOffsets'.

// Note that all pixel snapping is disabled for printing.

#pragma mark Supporting nestable alpha

// Unfortunately there seems to be no way to access the current alpha value in a Quartz context. This makes it difficult
// to combine alpha values from different stages of drawing.
// The alpha support here is mainly providing storage and some simple methods. A more complete implementation would
// route save and restore of the CG context through this object to save and restore the alpha value, too.
// With this implementation saving and restoring the alpha value in the PWGraphicsContext is left to the client.
//
// Typical usage:
// 
//   CGFloat savedAlpha = context.currentAlpha;
//
//   CGContextSaveGState (ctx);
//   [context applyAlpha:x];
//
//   // Some drawing with combined alpha
//
//   CGContextRestoreGState (ctx);
//   [context restoreAlphaTo:savedAlpha];
