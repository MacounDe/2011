SimpleSynth
***********

SimpleSynth is a basic synthesizer application for iOS. It was created
for demonstration purposes in a talk I gave at Macoun 2011. The code is
partially based on the MixerHostAudio example project provided by Apple.
Other external sources are marked as such.

You might want to visit http://vu0.org/audio for additional reference
material and slides.

The Utils/ subdirectory contains tools for converting SoundFonts to
collections of WAV files, sutaible for usage on iOS.
